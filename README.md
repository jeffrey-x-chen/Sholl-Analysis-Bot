# Sholl-Analysis-Bot
 Automated sholl analysis program
The purpose of this program is to automatically perform Sholl Analysis on the 
coordinates of a traced neuron using the coordinate data of the start and end points 
of individual dendrite segments. The program receives an input of coordinate data 
from a manually traced neuron using the ImageScience plugin on ImageJ Fiji. The user is 
then meant to input the first and last coordinate of each segment. When the user is
finished, they can acess the number of dendrite intersections for each concentric
circle.
